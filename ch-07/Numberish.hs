-- class definitions are comprised of a set of operations and values all instances will provide. 
-- They donâ€™t define any terms or actual code implementations which we can compile and execute, only types.
-- The instances are unique pairings of 
--      a. the type the instance is for and
--      b. the class the instance is being defined for
