-- This function performs right shift operations of a character over the raster, beginning at the point where it's character matches the one that was given.
-- The shift amount is indicated by the given offset parameter.
-- The character that sits at that final position of the raster, when the shifts are completed, is the character to be returned.
-- If the offset value is larger than the length of the raster, shifting will continue a the opposite end of the raster until 0 has been reached.
-- Even though shifts are always moving from left to right, the underlying order of the raster can change based on the value of the "Direction"  constructor.
