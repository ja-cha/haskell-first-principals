module MaybeTransformer where


{-
  "MaybeT" is a monad transformer for combining the effects of an 
  underlying monad "m" with those of the "Maybe" monad.
  "m" can be any monad such as IO, State, Reader, etc.
  "a" is the type of the value the Maybe monad wraps. 
  The purpose of "MaybeT" is to 
  lift the "Maybe" monad into the underlying monad "m", 
  thus combining their effects.
